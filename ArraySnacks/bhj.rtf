I am drawn to the University of Illinois for its unparalleled synergy of computational materials innovation and industry-driven research. Faculty like Prof. Marie Agathe Champagne (additive manufacturing/data science) and Prof. Pascal Bellion (materials for extreme conditions) directly align with my goal to design self-healing alloys using machine learning. Illinois\'92 Materials Research Laboratory and partnerships with industry leaders like Caterpillar offer the ideal ecosystem to bridge my research on predictive modeling with scalable, sustainable solutions\'97critical for addressing Nigeria\'92s industrial challenges. This program\'92s interdisciplinary ethos and global impact focus will empower me to become a leader in translating materials science into real-world progress.}
